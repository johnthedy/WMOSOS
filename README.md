# WMOSOS
Weighted Multi Objective Symbiotic Organism Search

This is multiobjective optimization algorithm modified from SOS
Current algorithm can only be applied into two objectives problem
Modify the fobj.m file to suit your own problem.

It requires input of:
ite = total iteration number
increment = objective weighting interval
n = number of optimized variable
lb = lower bound of each optimized parameters
ub = upper bound of each optimized parameters
